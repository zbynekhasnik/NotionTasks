## Overview
Notion Tasks Dev is a client-side Android app that helps you create tasks in your own Notion workspace. The app uses Notion OAuth to access your Notion data and writes directly to Notion. We do not operate a database for your content.

## Data We Collect
- OAuth tokens provided by Notion (access and refresh tokens).
- App configuration stored locally (selected database and fields).
- Optional offline queue stored locally until synced.

We do not collect or store your task content on any developer-controlled server.

## How Data Is Used
- Tokens are used to call the Notion API on your behalf.
- Configuration is used to render your custom input form.
- Offline queue is used to sync tasks when you are back online.

## Where Data Is Stored
All tokens, configuration, and offline tasks are stored locally on your device using encrypted storage. No user data is stored by the developer.

## Sharing of Data
Data is only shared with Notion through their API. We do not share your data with third parties.

## Security
Tokens are stored in encrypted storage on the device. Network traffic is encrypted via HTTPS.

## Your Choices
You can disconnect the app at any time, which removes tokens and local configuration from the device.
